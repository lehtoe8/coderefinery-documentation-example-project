# coderefinery-documentation-example-project
Example project for coderefinery documentation lesson

This project is part of an exercise for learning how to do proper documentation. Specifically I am trying to write a good readme-file. I am not feeling very confident about my abilities in this regard.

Since I have now seen the example solution I shall try to reproduce it.

## What is this project?
This project contains tools for analysing spreadsheets with temperature data.

## How to use the tools?
See *requirements.txt* to be able to run the script. Run the file *analyze_spreadsheet.py* and input name of the file you wish to use to print the columns of the spreadsheet as well as the mean temperatures.
